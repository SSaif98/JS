//7 Premitive Data Types

//Number [use for decimal and integer]
let num = 45

//String
let str = "Saif"

//Boolean
let bool1 = true
let bool2 = false

//Undefined  --variable is only declared
let undef;

//Null   --If we add any thing in null value the null will act as 0 and will add any thing in it.
let nullVal = null;

//BigInt  -larger integer that Number DT can hold
let bigNum = BigInt(100000000000000000)

//In JS the value has the TYPE not the variable

console.log(typeof num)
console.log(typeof str)
console.log(typeof bool1)
console.log(typeof nullVal)
console.log(typeof undef)
console.log(typeof bigNum)


//Dynamic Typing: We can easily change the type of a value that is hold by a variable.
