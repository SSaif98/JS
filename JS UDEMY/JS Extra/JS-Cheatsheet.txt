JAVASCRIPT:

node :  It is an engine that will run your js file.
node fileName.js

Variable in JS is very losely coupled. Means we do not have to give the type of variable.
var name= "Saif"
var age=25

ES5 var
ES6 var, let, const
var and let are almost same
const is different from these 2.

 
/*
Difference between var and let and const
 let:   We can not redeclare varibale with let keyword
 var:   We can redeclare variable with var keyword
 const: We can not reassign or redeclare variable with const keyword.

 In var and let: We can reassign value in both type of variables.
*/


//if you want to see which variable if of which type.
console.log(typeof(b))

/*
2 more datat types: null & undefined

null : if we define null value then this variable of datatype NULL
undefined: if we donot define any thing then it is undefined.

*/

var array2 = [1,2,3,4]

console.log(array2) //[1, 2, 3, 4]

array2.push(12) // add 12 at the end of array2
array2.unshift(15) // add 15 at the start of array2
array2.pop() // delete a value at the end of array2
array2.indexOf(100) //Find index of any element
array2.includes(70)  //Find if specific element present in array
var subArray= array2.slice(2, 4)  // Create subarray from main array. slice method accpets 2 index parameters (parameter1 , parameter -1)
console.log(subArray)


The Difference Between Arrays and Objects
● In JavaScript, arrays use numbered indexes.
● In JavaScript, objects use named indexes.

You should use objects when you want the element names to be strings (text).
You should use arrays when you want the element names to be numbers.



Different Kinds of Loops
JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:
● for - loops through a block of code a number of times
● for/in - loops through the properties of an object
● for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
● while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
● do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

Async JS:
Start something now and finish later.

JS is syncronys. JS can run one statement at a time. Single threaded.
